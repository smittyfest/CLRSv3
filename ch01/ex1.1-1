1.1-1
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or
a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

Solution :-
Sorting: Sorting names lexicographically in order to 
provide faster lookups, sorting items by timestamp 
in order to evict the oldest.
Convex-Hull: Finding the shortest-path when solid obstacles 
are blocking the direct route.
